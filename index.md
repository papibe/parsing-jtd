# Advent of Parsing 2022

How to parse the input files for all days

## About

- Basic of reading files on Python
- Eliminate new line character (“\n”)
- Divide days into categories
- Caveat:

    > Usually I mean to parse as to get the data from a file into an Python object that is easy to either iterate, analyse or transform thus facilitating solving the problem.

    > Different people may think different approaches to represent the data. For instance, a particular data can be store in a list of lists, or into a dictionary.
    There could be more parsing strategies that I’m not seeing.

    > Also, I'm not considering getting the data into objects from custom classes.
